                    After 10 years, I am now an astronomer and a researcher.On the 6th day of 6th month, we got signal from our lost spacecraft,
                    'UPDIKESUV108'. This spaceship was launched nine years back and till two years of launch, we got signal after that our connections
                    are disconneted.
                    Now it reached at 3.29 billion light years. This satellite is most advanced version of
                    Voyger and James Webb Telescope. This satellite is able to attain 99% of speed of light.

                    This satellite-spaceship is very light and contain very less mass.
                    The mission was started for finding the Electromagnetic waves and mysterious signals and sounds in space.
                    In the very first two years it has provided a lots of information of the space.
                    It found Oxygen-clouds in many places in the space, which sparked the idea of Aliens.
                    Many controversial events were predicted by this, which voilent the law of physics.
                    It found cold red gaint, black-hole, supernova, and many more.

                Since from many years Scientists are amazed about these unknown frequencies from space, they started a space mission.
                After few minutes of unknown signal we lost the signal and once again we lost hope of getting space answer.
                But after reading the signals, we come to know that the UPDIKESUV108 has reached at another galaxy and had covered a lot of distanec from Milky Way Galaxy.
                And once again the unknown frequency is undetected.
                We continued our investigation for about four months but not reached to any source to any source of clue.

                It was little cold and autumn. Leaves were dancing on the road from here to there. Trees had lost all leaves and becoming big gaint of woods.
                But it has hope to regain its' beauty after few months.
                I was discussing these things with my bestie, Skye.
                It was 6 p.m., and we were walking outside our company.Suddenly a breezy wind passed from us.
                This blink an idea in her mind. She suggest me for going to hike. But I denied.
                Again she forced. I agreed. After a lots of discussion about place. We agreed for going to Kuchhu Bau, the place where our city ends.
                The trip was on Saturday morning. So, I was ready and also taken my laptop and mobile as I lost last time and don't have map also.
                By the way, we continued our journey and in this journey I saw many changes but the final destination remains untouched by humans.

                <br>
                Still Same.
                <br>
                <br><br>
                
                <img src="img/journey.png">
    
                <br><br>
    
                The map contains path from intial to final destination of the Gaggu Hills.The banayan tree, I remember
                last time the house of Mr.Nathu was there. We continued our journey. After a long walk we ate chips.
                When I just opened the chips packet one of the monkey snatched from my hand and ran away.
                This time I didn't follow them. And continued our journey.
                After few hours, we are under banayan tree, but couldn't found the old man's house.
                Lots of creepers were there. And on the branch of banayan tree, a lot of monkeys were watching us. Skye get message on
                the phone so she take out the phone from purse but unexpectedly it has fallen down in the lots of creepers.
                We both jump into searching the phone by removing the creepers and finally got her phone.
                The active monkeies started copying us. And we continued our journey by ignoring them. After few minutes we are at Gaggu Hills.
                We have taken selfies from Skye's very precious phone. Then we had a picnic and after some hours, we continued our journey to come back.
                This time the banayan tree seemed unusual. Omg! this is the same place where we can't see house few monutes back, but now we get the house back.
                We went there, no lock was there on the door.
                It was completely vacant, so we entered in the house. This time it is not well-maintained but beside mirror,
                there was a note hung on the wall.
                It might left by the man. The note states :<br>

                        Welcome, the unknown. This is my house. And I live here for many years. I am a scientist and an astrologer. I am making a project "AMRIT",
                        which makes immunity hundred times stronger and increase the life expectancy. I have tested on 25 people and results are impressive. But 
                        I am unable to complete my analysis. One fine day, I was visiting jungle and suddenly I saw bright light and faint down. From that day I'am
                        ill and got acute heart-attack. So, I am now hopitalised and may be not coming there, anymore. This, I handle it to my friend so that he
                        keep this in my best place. I have mentioned "Amrit" because I know this note is on right hand.
                                                                                   ~ Your Grandpa

                        I saw this note to Skye. She asked me what then?
                        <br>
                        I went to his lab and she followed me. I started searching astrology book. Lots of creepers are there. Skye's phone
                        was vibrating continously so she went out from the room. I was still searching. I got a wooden box, which seems to 
                        important so I kept aside. On the fourth corner of wall I got the book. I opened it and read the last page, it was written.
                        "The universe is in danger from precarious creature. Unity can save it." And half page was blank.
                        <br>
                        Suddenly I hear the screeming of Skye. I went out with the box and book. I saw she was faint on the earth.
                        I have given water and her asthama medicine. And taken her into the house.
                        I have tried to call hospital but my phone was off and Skye's phone doesn't have any signal.
                        I was in picnic, but slowly she opened her eyes and I felt a breezy of relaxation. 
                        <br>
                        I didn't ask her anything and given fruits and water and cleaned the foor. Made a bed from leaves and asked her to 
                        take a rest. She felt weak, so she slept. I still got continous vibration on her phone. I checked her phone.
                        A message notification on her phone was there.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The phone has some signal so I called ambulance. I saw Mr.Elixer had called her. I checked the message. I was shocked.
                        <br>
                        The news is of "UPDIKESUV108", once again we are getting signal from the satellite we lost.
                        And this time the signal may be encoded with some messages which we are unable to find out.
                        Then I came out of the house, and sat under the oak tree. Suddenly my eyes caught the view that the place where Skye
                        was standing was darken. I went there it was like grey ash and few leaves were burnt.
                        Before I could understand anything, Skye screamed and I went inside the door of the house.
